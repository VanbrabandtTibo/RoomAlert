## Roomalert

RoomAlert stands for a device that measures the air quality in your office.
Since I've been working in my office all day because of Corona, I don't always realize that the air quality is very bad.
That's why I made this project so that I'm aware of the CO2 level in the room. Other then that, It also captures the humidity and temperature.

For this project I've used Python3, HTML, CSS and Javascript. The code editor I used was Visual Studio Code because it has a nice plugin called "Remote SSH", an easy to use program to edit code remote from your Raspberry Pi.

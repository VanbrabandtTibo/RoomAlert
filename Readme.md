## Roomalert

RoomAlert stands for a device that measures the air quality in your office.
Since I've been working in my office all day because of Corona, I don't always realize that the air quality is very bad.
That's why I made this project so that I'm aware of the CO2 level in the room. Other then that, It also captures the humidity and temperature.
